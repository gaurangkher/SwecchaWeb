Hi Team,
<br /><br />
After a plan almost getting postponed, we Spent lovely time with around 50 children at Udyogdham (Talegaon}, a place with children having leprosy(kushtarog).
<br /><br />
We met Sanjeevani Taai who along with a couple manages that place, and we got to know about the Organization and their daily routine.<br />
They introduced the children to us and...<br />
Beleive me! they  all were more than happy to see us and play with us, so we grabed this opportunity to know them well and played couple of games. One as passing the ball and 2nd being cricket.<br />
Me n Sunil were teamed up and Amol N Sarode were our opposition with around 12 boys in each team (of age group 6 to 15).<br />We won all the  matches and the series convincingly by 3-0, and of course the hearts of kids!<br />
We could actually see the excitement, enthusisam and the happiness in each one of them, by just WE BEING THERE...
<br /><br />
Now,the reason m writing in such detail is that we want everyone to feel that moment and how it was an amazing visit.
<br /><br />
As a feedback Sanjeevani Taai said it wud b great that if u can spend time with them on weekends so that it could help them learn something new and in a creative way.<br />
Amol, Sunil Barkhade, Anand Sarode And Me on Behalf of' SWECHHA' gave our best wishes.
<br /><br />
Any feedback from all of u is welcomed as always....and we also want recommendations for our 2 nd visit...
<br /><br />
And Yes TOGETHER WE CAN..Make it Happen!....
<br /><br />
Cheers and Regards,<br />
Raunak

It was my first time ever to visit to any such social welfare firms,<br />
The experience was simply astounding.<br /> N i was amazed to see their level of commitment of social worker 24/7 there and after discussing about work done by udyogdham v had clear n new views on this subject n how we can contribute our part of seva.<br /> Other than just money donation.<br />
<br /><br />
Lets hope that we can meet to expectation of society from our Swechha group n to fulfill aim of 'empowering weaker sector of society, by making them independent'.
<br /><br />
Thanks & Regards,<br />
Amol
